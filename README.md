# About Me
I have a bachelor's degree in Production Engineering, and from the beginning, I knew I would work with technology in some capacity. I enjoy learning in detail how things work and acquiring new knowledge. I have been involved in multidisciplinary projects in the data field, but my career focus and direction are towards MLOps and software development.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PicPay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/picpay).
